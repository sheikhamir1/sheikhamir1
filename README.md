Hello, my name is Sheikh Amir. I'm from Kolkata, India. I'm a college student with a passion for programming and development. I also love fitness! 😉 I don't come from a background where I knew everything about coding and programming from the beginning. It's just been a short while since I started, and when I did, I couldn't help but wonder why I didn't start earlier! 😅

Anyway, I'm currently preparing to become a full-stack web developer. I've learned many things, but there's still so much more to explore and learn. I've studied HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I've even completed some projects that you can find in my GitHub repository. Later, I dived into CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, Material UI, Bulma, Tailwind, and Flowbite.

After that, I began learning and working with React.js, a front-end framework, and I'm still learning and working on projects with it. In the future insha-allah, I plan to explore backend development and databases.

In addition to my tech journey, I'm a fitness trainer and content creator. I also do research in Islamic sciences, like  hadith , and jurisprudence , I also delve into the four legal schools of thought in Islam with a scholarly approach of extensive research work.

I've seen many awesome repos on GitHub, and while mine might be simple right now, I'm on a journey where, at some point, I hope my repos will look more professional. It all depends on hard work! 😊
